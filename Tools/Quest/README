IBM Quest Synthetic Data Generator

I cannot remember the original source of this version, maybe from IBM Quest
Project's official site or from M. J. Zaki's site for very long time. Several
modifications have been done in order to make it compilable by latest C++
compilers.

The license is not clear, but should be an opensource one, maybe GPL.
